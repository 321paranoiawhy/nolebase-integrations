# [N√≥l√´base](https://github.com/nolebase/nolebase) Integrations

[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](./README.zh-CN.md)

---

A collection of diverse documentation engineering tools.

> [N√≥l√´base](https://github.com/nolebase/nolebase) is an open-source knowledge base named after N√≥l√´base, pronounced as nole-base, derived from the Quenya word 'n√≥l√´' meaning 'knowledge' and the English word 'base', hence 'knowledge base'.

## Features

- üöÄ Documentation Engineering First
  - From the perspective of documentation engineering, solve and simplify some UX/DX problems, aiming to let creators focus on writing documents, notes, making cards and GTD!
- ‚öñÔ∏è Compatible and Easy to Use
  - Whether it is static-first like VitePress, or client-first like Obsidian, the "N√≥l√´base Integrations" project hopes to provide a similar or even better experience across different platforms.
- üß© Rich Features
  - Each platform has its own advantages and missing features, but the documentation engineering is already time-consuming and labor-intensive. These issues should not be obstacles to restrict the writing and sharing of documents and knowledge. Expand your imagination far beyond with N√≥l√´base Integrations.

## How to develop

The project uses [`unbuild`](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild) and [`vite`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) to develop and build. With the powerful features offered from [`jiti`](https://github.com/unjs/jiti), we no longer need to use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for tedious configuration and then watch the local file changes and bundle the modified and developed the modules without [`vite`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) for hot-reload. We can directly run the following command to output the bundled file and get started on development:

```shell
pnpm run packages:stub
```

If you use [`@antfu/ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni), you can also use the following command:

```shell
nr packages:stub
```

Next, you need to start the the documentation site (with VitePress) for previewing and development. You can use the following command:

```shell
pnpm run docs:dev
```

If you use [`@antfu/ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni), you can also use the following command:

```shell
nr docs:dev
```

## How to build

```shell
pnpm run packages:build
```

If you use [`@antfu/ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni), you can also use the following command:

```shell
nr packages:build
```

To build the documentation and preview site, you can use the following command:

```shell
pnpm run docs:build
```

If you use [`@antfu/ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni), you can also use the following command:

```shell
nr docs:build
```
